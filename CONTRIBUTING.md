## Bug reports

Bug reports and feature suggestions must use descriptive and concise titles and be submitted to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ajbura/cinny/issues). Please use the search function to make sure that you are not submitting duplicates, and that a similar report or request has not already been resolved or rejected.

## Pull requests

> ### Legal Notice
> When contributing to this project, you must agree that you have authored 100% of the content, that you have the necessary rights to the content and that the content you contribute may be provided under the project license.

**NOTE: If you want to add new features, please discuss with maintainers before coding or opening a pull request.** This is to ensure that we are on same track and following our roadmap.

**Please use clean, concise titles for your pull requests.** We use commit squashing, so the final commit in the dev branch will carry the title of the pull request. For easier sorting in changelog, start your pull request titles using one of the verbs "Add", "Change", "Remove", or "Fix" (present tense).

Example:

|Not ideal|Better|
|---|----|
|Fixed markAllAsRead in RoomTimeline|Fix read marker when paginating room timeline|

It is not always possible to phrase every change in such a manner, but it is desired.

**The smaller the set of changes in the pull request is, the quicker it can be reviewed and merged.** Splitting tasks into multiple smaller pull requests is often preferable.

Also, we use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for clean and stylistically consistent code syntax, so make sure your pull request follow it.

**For any query or design discussion, join our [Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#cinny:matrix.org).**
